          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,â€”and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow, and blessed thee for it.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou exuberant star!</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Like thee must I go down, as men say, to whom I shall descend.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest happiness without envy!</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again going to be a man.</p></div>

          <div class='p-wrapper'><p>Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.</p></div>
